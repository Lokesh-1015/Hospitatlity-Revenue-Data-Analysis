# Hospitatlity-Revenue-Data-Analysis

This project involves creating a dynamic and visually engaging hotel performance dashboard in Power BI. The dashboard provides key metrics such as Revenue, RevPAR, Occupancy %, ADR, Realization %, and Cancellation % across multiple properties and booking platforms. It includes interactive filters for cities, room types, and time periods, allowing users to analyze trends and compare performance effectively. The design integrates modern visualizations like pie charts, line charts, and stacked column charts, along with KPI cards that highlight performance changes. This dashboard is a powerful tool for decision-makers to monitor and optimize hotel operations.
